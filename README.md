#Interactiles

[Portfolio Link](https://showspace.so/p/9350)

##Idea
Developing an interactive grid of buttons that light up and change colors when pressed, designed to communicate, connect, and create art across distances. 
Each grid is connected via the internet to a corresponding grid, allowing users to share visual messages in real-time.

##Current status
This project serves mostly as a platform for me to build on my coding and hardware skills. The current prototype is a version with a 2x2 grid of RGB LED switches, currently not connected to the internet or each other.

##To Do
[x]Experiment with RGB Switches
[x]Build hand-wired POC
[x]Design PCB for 2x2 version
[x]Assemble & test 2x2 version
[]Set up web server
[]Connect individual interactiles to web server
[]Web interface for monitoring
[]Develop large scale version
[]Large scale version module development
[]Build large scale version
[]deploy
